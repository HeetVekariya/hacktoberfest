2. Create your own branch using `git checkout -b name_of_your_branch`
3. cd into the submissions folder and then into the folder for the category for which you would like to build your app.
4. Create a folder with the name of your project (please start this folder name with your name)
5. Build your app in this folder
6. When your app is finished create a PR into the main branch
