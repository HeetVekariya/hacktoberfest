# 🎃 Reflex Hacktoberfest Competition 🎃

Welcome to the Reflex's 2024 Hacktoberfest.

## 🤔 What to Build

This year we have a couple tracks:

- Best use of AG Grid--a component that we recently finished building support for
- [Wrapping various React components in Reflex](#wrapping-custom-components) see below
- Most aesthetic Reflex app
- Best developer experience--an app that improves the developer experience of some workflow e.g. writing changelogs, writing documentation, etc.

### ⚙️ **How it works**

- As an official Reflex Hacker, you can receive cash rewards, custom-branded swag, peer networking and education opportunities, access to beta updates, and more!

When you have finished building your app:

2. Submit a link to your app in the suubmissions.md file

In addition, share a link to your deployed app in the [Showcase channel](https://discord.com/channels/1029853095527727165/1063735841333198938) on our Discord.
